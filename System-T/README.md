# SystemT

SystemT is commercial software and therefore we cannot directly provide the code to reproduce the experiments. For this reason we refer the reader to the guide for its use via cloud interface:

[Tutorial SystemT](https://github.com/System-T/Tutorial-KDD-2019) see Lab1

To use the system, it will be enough to upload the rules and corpus to the cloud soluion and start the system using the one related to Italian as the tokenizer.

SystemT has been tested in embedded form starting with native Java code. For ease we report the performance related to CPU and RAM through the following plots.
