# Apache UIMA Ruta

For basic installation we refer to the complete guide at the following link [link](https://uima.apache.org/ruta.html).

Also using the example project of Apache guide, copy the files inside the folder corpus into the input folder,and overwrite the script and resources folders with the ones in this directory.
Start the programing debug mode. In the view statistics there are information about the total computation time and the time taken by each component.


To check performance, CPU and RAM use [link](https://visualvm.github.io)

For ease we report the performance related to CPU and RAM through the following plots.
