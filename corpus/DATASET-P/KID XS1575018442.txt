If , at maturity , the final reference price of the @nl underlying has fallen below the barrier price , the product may return less than the product notional amount or even zero . @nl Early termination following an autocall : The product will terminate prior to the maturity date if , on any autocall observation date , the reference @nl price is at or above the relevant autocall barrier price . On any such early termination , you will on the immediately following autocall payment @nl date receive , in addition to any final interest payment , a cash payment equal to the autocall payment of EUR 1,000.00 .
