It shows how likely it is that the product will lose money because @nl of movements in the markets or because we are not able to pay you . @nl We have classified this product as 6 out of 7 , which is a high risk class . This rates @nl the potential losses from future performance at a medium level , and poor market @nl conditions are likely to impact our capacity to pay you . If you hold the product until @nl maturity you are entitled to receive back at least 10 per cent of your capital .
