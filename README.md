# EMNLP 2022

This guide is intended to guide the reader for reproducing the experiments and testing the solution.

## Folders

The folders in this path contain the files so you can start the rule engines. In each folder you will find a subguide that will help you with the specific solution.
The corpus folder, on the other hand, contains within it the two corpora considered, namely the one of ~7100 documents(DATASET-P) and the automatically annotated one of ~650 documents(DATASET-Q).

The folders are:

* GATE
* CoreNLP
* SystemT
* Apache UIMA 

## TABLE-Extraction

Regarding table extraction, refer to the code within the Table-Extraction table, use the documents in the corpus folder belonging to DATASET-Q_O and DATASET-P_O containing the original pdfs for testing.

the dataset for fine-tuning is contained in the dataset-annotated-tables folder.

NOTE: We will totally provide the code of the implemented solution following the publication of the work
